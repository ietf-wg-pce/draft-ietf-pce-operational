1.  Introduction

   Due to different interpretations of PCEP standards, it was found that
   implementations often had to adjust their behavior in order to
   interoperate.  The current document serves to clarify certain aspects
   of PCEP to make it easier to produce interoperable implementations of
   PCEP.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   PCC: Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
   path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE: Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application, or
   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

   PCEP: Path Computation Element Protocol.

   MBB: Make-Before-Break.  A procedure during which the head-end of a
   traffic-engineered path wishes to move traffic to a new path without
   losing any traffic, by first "making" a new path and then "breaking"
   the old path.

   Association parameters: As described in [RFC8697], the combination of
   the mandatory fields Association type, Association ID and Association
   Source in the ASSOCIATION object uniquely identify the association
   group.  If the optional TLVs - Global Association Source or Extended
   Association ID are included, then they MUST be included in
   combination with mandatory fields to uniquely identify the
   association group.

   Association information: As described in [RFC8697], the ASSOCIATION
   object could also include other optional TLVs based on the
   association types, that provides 'information' related to the
   association type.

   ERO: Explicit Route Object is the path of the LSP encoded into a PCEP
   object.  To represent an empty ERO object, i.e., without any
   subobjects, we use the notation "ERO={}".  To represent an ERO object
   containing some given sequence of subobjects, we use the notation
   "ERO={A}".

4.  PCEP LSP Database

   We use the concept of the LSP-DB, as a database of actual LSP state
   in the network, to illustrate the internal state of PCEP speakers in
   response to various PCEP messages.

   Note that the term "LSP", which stands for "Label Switched Path", if
   taken too literally would restrict our discussion to MPLS dataplane
   only.  We take the term "LSP" to apply to non-MPLS paths as well, to
   avoid changing the name.  Alternatively, we could rename LSP to
   "Instance".

4.1.  Structure

   LSP-DB contains two types of objects: LSPs and Tunnels.  An LSP is
   identified by the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV.  A Tunnel is identified by the
   PLSP-ID in the LSP object and/or the SYMBOLIC-NAME.  See [RFC8231].

   A Tunnel may or may not be an actual tunnel on the router.  For
   example, working and protect paths can be implemented as a single
   tunnel interface, but in PCEP we would refer to them as two different
   Tunnels, because they would have different PLSP-IDs.

   An LSP can be thought of as a instance of a Tunnel.  In steady-state,
   a Tunnel has only one LSP, but during make-before-break (see
   [RFC3209]) it can have multiple LSPs, to represent both new and old
   instances that exist simultaneously for a time.

4.2.  Synchronization

   Both PCE and PCC maintain their separate copies of the LSP-DB.  The
   PCE LSP-DB is only modified by PCRpt messages, no other PCEP message
   may modify the PCE LSP-DB.  The PCC LSP-DB is built from actual
   forwarding state that PCC has installed.  PCC uses PCRpt messages to
   synchronize its local LSP-DB to the PCE.

   The PCE MUST always act on the latest state of the PCE LSP DB.  Note
   that this does not mean that the PCE cannot use information from
   outside of LSP-DB.  For example, the PCE can use other mechanisms to
   collect traffic statistics and use them in the computation.  However,
   these traffic statistics are not part of the LSP-DB, but only
   reference it.

   The LSP-DB on both the PCC and the PCE only stores the actual state
   in the network, it does not store the desired state.  For example,
   consider the case of PCE Initiated LSP, configured on the PCE.  When
   the operator modifies the configuration of this LSP, that is a change
   in desired state.  The actual state has not yet changed, so LSP-DB is
   not modified yet.  The LSP-DB is only modified after the PCE sends
   PCInit/PCUpd message to the PCC and the PCC decides to act on that
   message.  When the PCC acts on a message from a PCE, it would update
   its own PCC LSP DB and send a PCRpt to the PCE(s) to synchronize the
   change.  When the PCE receives the PCRpt msg, it updates its own PCE
   LSP DB.  After this, the PCC LSP-DB and PCE LSP-DB are in sync.

4.3.  Successful MBB

   Below we give an example of doing MBB to switch the Tunnel from one
   path to another.  We represent the path encoded into the ERO object
   as ERO={A} and ERO={B}.

   PCC has an existing LSP in UP state, with LSP-ID=2.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2, ERO={A}, OPER-FLAG=UP).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, ERO={A}, OPER=UP                  |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 1: Content of LSP DB

   PCC initiates the MBB procedure by creating a new LSP with LSP-ID=3.
   It does not matter what triggered the creation of the new LSP, it
   could have been due to a new path received via PCUpd (if the given
   Tunnel is delegated), or it could have been local computation on the
   PCC (if the Tunnel is locally computed on the PCC), or it could have
   been a change in configuration on the PCC (if the Tunnel's path is
   explicitly configured on the PCC).  It is important to emphasize that
   the procedure for updating the LSP-DB is common, regardless of the
   trigger that caused the change.

   PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=3, ERO={B}, OPER-
   FLAG=UP).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, ERO={A}, OPER=UP                  |
   |                 | LSP-ID=3, ERO={B}, OPER=UP                  |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 2: Content of LSP DB

   After traffic has successfully switched to the new LSP, the PCC
   cleans up the old LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=1, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-
   ID=2).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=3, ERO={B}, OPER=UP                  |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

4.4.  Aborted MBB

   The MBB process can abort when the newly created LSP is destroyed
   before it is installed as traffic carrying.  This scenario is
   described below.

   PCC has an existing LSP in UP state, with LSP-ID=2.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, OPER-FLAG=UP, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, OPER=UP                           |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 4: Content of LSP DB

   MBB procedure is initiated, a new LSP is created with LSP-ID=3.  LSP
   is currently being established, so its oper state is DOWN.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, OPER-FLAG=DOWN, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=3).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, OPER=UP                           |
   |                 | LSP-ID=3, OPER=DOWN                         |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 5: Content of LSP DB

   MBB procedure is aborted.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=1, PLSP-ID=100,
   LSP-ID=3).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | TUNNEL          | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | PLSP-ID=100     | LSP-ID=2, OPER=UP                           |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

5.  PCEP Association Database

   PCEP Association is a group of zero or more LSPs.

   The PCE ASSO DB is populated by PCRpt messages and/or via
   configuration on the PCE itself.  An Association is identified by the
   Association Parameters.  The Association parameters contain many
   fields, so for convenience we will group all the fields into a single
   value.  We will use ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_PARAM=B, to refer to different
   PCEP Associations: A and B, respectively.

5.1.  LSPs in same Association

   Below, we give an example to illustrate how LSPs join the same
   Association.

   PCC creates the first LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100,
   LSP-ID=1, ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_R_FLAG=0).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO            | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO_PARAM=A    | PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=1                       |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 7: Content of PCE ASSO DB

   PCC creates the second LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=200,
   LSP-ID=1, ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_R_FLAG=0).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO            | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO_PARAM=A    | PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=1                       |
   |                 | PLSP-ID=200, LSP-ID=1                       |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 8: Content of PCE ASSO DB

   PCC updates the first LSP, the PCC is NOT REQUIRED to send the
   ASSOCIATION object in this PCRpt, since the LSP is already in the
   Association.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=1).  The
   content of the PCE ASSO DB is unchanged.  Note that the PCC sends the
   ASSOCIATION OBJECT in the first PCRpt during SYNC state, even if it
   has already issued a PCRpt with the association object sometime in
   the past with this PCE.  The synchronization steps outlined in
   [RFC8697] are to be followed.

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO            | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO_PARAM=A    | PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=1                       |
   |                 | PLSP-ID=200, LSP-ID=1                       |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 9: Content of PCE ASSO DB

   PCC decides to delete the second LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=1,
   PLSP-ID=200, LSP-ID=1).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO            | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO_PARAM=A    | PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=1                       |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 10: Content of PCE ASSO DB

   PCC decides to remove the first LSP from the Association, but not
   delete the LSP itself.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-
   ID=1, ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_R_FLAG=1).  The PCE ASSO DB is now empty.

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO            | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO_PARAM=A    |                                             |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 11: Content of PCE ASSO DB

5.2.  Switch Association during MBB

   Below, we give an example to illustrate how a Tunnel goes through MBB
   and switches from Association A to Association B.

   Each new LSP (identified by the LSP-ID) does not inherit the
   Association membership of any previous LSPs within the same Tunnel.
   This is so that a Tunnel can have two LSPs that are in different
   Associations, this may be done when switching from one Association to
   another.

   PCC creates the first LSP.  PCC sends PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100,
   LSP-ID=1, ASSO_PARAM=A, ASSO_R_FLAG=0).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO            | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO_PARAM=A    | PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=1                       |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                   Figure 12: Content of PCE ASSO DB

   PCC creates the MBB LSP in a different Association.  PCC sends
   PCRpt(R-FLAG=0, PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2, ASSO_PARAM=B, ASSO_R_FLAG=0).

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO            | LSP                                         |
   +-----------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO_PARAM=A    | PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=1                       |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ASSO_PARAM=B    | PLSP-ID=100, LSP-ID=2                       |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   ID=1).

6.  Computation Constraints

   For any PCEP object that does not have an explicit removal flag, the
   absence of that object indicates removal of the constraint specified
   by that object.  For example, suppose the first state-report contains
   an LSPA object with some affinity constraints.  Then if a subsequent
   state-report does not contain an LSPA object, then this means that
   the previously specified affinity constraints do not apply anymore.
   Same applies to all PCEP objects, like METRIC, BANDWIDTH, etc., which
   do not have an explicit flag for removal.  This simply ensures that
   it is possible to remove a constraint without using an explicit
   removal flag.

7.  Overloaded PCE

   [RFC5440] defines the concept of an Overloaded PCE and explains how a
   PCE may signal to a PCC that it is congested, instructing that "no
   requests should be sent to that PCE until the overload state is
   cleared."

   In the case of an overloaded PCE, this document clarifies that it is
   RECOMMENDED a PCC send a PcReq to a backup PCE instead if the primary
   PCE is overloaded.

   [RFC8231] builds upon [RFC5440] by introducing the concept of a
   Stateful PCE, which allows delegation of LSP control to a single PCE.
   However, it does not address the case of an overloaded PCE.
   According to [RFC8231], a PCE maintains delegation until it is
   revoked by the PCC or returned back to PCC by the PCE.  The PCC may
   revoke delegation and re-assign it to another PCE.

   As a result, a PCE in an overload state still retains LSP delegation.
   For PCC-initiated LSPs, the PCC MAY revoke delegation from the
   overloaded PCE and maintain delegation for itself or delegate it to
   another PCE.  For PCE-initiated LSPs, since the PCC cannot revoke
   delegation as per [RFC8281], the overloaded PCE MAY return the
   delegation to the PCC.

   This document clarifies that a PCC MUST continue to send PcRpt
   messages to a PCE in overload state otherwise the LSP-DB on PCE may
   go out of sync.
